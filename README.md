# Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data

In this project, the goal was to wrangle (gather, assess, and clean) data from the Twitter account **_"WeRateDogs", @dog_rates_**. Once wrangling was done, we were to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by a short written report of what work was done. I completed this project using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

Please see the document "Wrangle Report" for more details on what I accomplished in this project.
